1.What does a loop do?
 - A loop repeats the same task until a specified condition becomes false.
Why do we use i < arr.length?
 - Arrays are zero-indexed, so valid indexes go from 0 to length - 1.
Using i < arr.length prevents accessing undefined. 
When should a function return instead of console.log?
-A function should return when the value needs to be reused, tested, or passed to another function.
