What is the first value of i?
First value of i is 0.
What is the last value of i?
Last value of i is arr.length - 1.
Why do we use i < arr.length and NOT i <= arr.length?
We use i < arr.length because array indexes go from 0 to length - 1.
   Using i <= arr.length would access arr[length], which is undefined.
